# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: Module 1 Challenge

### Purpose : The purpose of this Excel Challenge project is to test the understanding and to use some modeling functions to provide feedback.

## Analysis and Challenges:The main goal is to provide feedback to Louise for her fundraising projects by using this Kickstarter dataset. To get big picture, one uses Pivoting tables, graphes, and other tools.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: There is a strong success in May and June, and overall there are more successful months than failed months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: She barely attained her goal based on percentage of success and failure. Lower goals are more successful than larger goals. About one third of her projects failed. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: I have a longer leaning period than expected. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One needs to spends more efforts in May and June to maximize positive outcomes. December is not a good month for the team.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Smaller goals have greater success. She can focus more on project between $35000 adn $44999 because they have 67% rate of success. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We have enough data to make sound decisions. They were plenty of years of data to go thru. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
None
